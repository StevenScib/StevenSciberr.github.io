        <p>Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) is a zero-sum game, typically played by two people using their hands and no tools.
            <br> Players make hand shapes, each with a certain degree of power, ultimately leading to an outcome.
            <br> RPS is popular worldwide, played by children and adults alike, and often used to make decisions where no room for cheating or predicting the other personâ€™s move is allowed.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What are the shapes of Rock Paper Scissors?</h2>
            <br>
            The rock is when you place your hand into the form of a simple fist.
            <br>
            The paper is when you place your hand in an outstretched position.
            <br>
            The scissors is when you hold your fist with your index and middle finger pointing outwards in a V shape.</p>
            <p>Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper and paper beats rock.</p>
